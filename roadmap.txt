Perfect, Jayden! Let’s break this down methodically. I’ll create a roadmap for the website and then we can start tackling it step by step. I’ll keep it high-level first and then we can dive into each section with concrete implementation plans.

Next Steps (Immediate)

Let’s tackle this step by step. Here’s a recommended first milestone:
1.	Home Landing Page
    o	Dark theme
    o	Overview sections linking to Articles, Videos, Calculators, Guides
    o	Hero section with CTA
2.	Free Articles
    o	Add category field
    o	Admin interface to select category
    o	Listing page with category filter

Once the articles system is fully functional, we can move on to studies, videos, calculators, and then the paid content / coaching sections.
 
If you want, we can start by scaffolding the home landing page with the hero + overview sections. This will give the site structure, navigation, and dark theme foundation before adding all the content sections.
